Case is held together by four M2 screws that screw in from the bottom, through the plate, and into the top.

I have printed most of the case in PLA on a P1P and things fit together well for me. I tried a bunch of different setups for the diffuser and I think the one that looked best was clear PETG, but it was kind of a pain to print. Clear PLA looked decent, too.
